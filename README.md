# Chatbot.py

A simple Python-based chatbot I built to experiment with conversation logic, prompts, and testing. This is a minimal CLI version, easy to tweak or expand with AI tools later.

## Features

- Responds to user input with basic logic
- Modular structure for adding prompts or rules
- A base for exploring prompt engineering or integrating APIs

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrisMit/chatbot.py
cd chatbot.py
